During the duel, you should counter the rock monster by immobilizing it with a binding spell and then casting magic at its weak spot to exploit its vulnerability and defeat it. However, your current experience level is not high enough to defeat the rock monster; you need to go to the school to level up first.\nJax: The rock monster is susceptible to ice magic, but only where it's vulnerable.\nJax: Flame Song Elemental University and Ancient Realm Wizard Academy are places to learn new magical spells. Only the Moon Shadow Magic Institute has the depth of expertise to raise your experience level.\nJax: To participate in the duel at the arena, you need to register in advance at the Adventurers Guild.\nJax: The rock monster's weak spot is in its mouth; you should focus your magic here to best the monster.\nJax: The rock monster is living petrification so using that spell will be ineffective against it.
